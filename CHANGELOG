Beta 3.1 Changes:

* Fixed serious bug resulting in the hierarchy being completely broken.  Doh!

Beta 3 Changes:

* New template tag <%%tpl filename%%> will be replaced by a sub-template parsed with the same data.
* Site-specific data repository now goes in DOCUMENT_ROOT/_data (by default).
* Auto-list processing replaced by Templation_Widget::metaToArray().
* Integer strings converted to actual PHP integers during meta gathering process.
* Action processing refactored (including some fixes).
* /tests/ directory added with standalone tests as well as full site tests based in tests/www
* Fixed src_filename to override src_name if it is specified.  This is necessary under certain mod_rewrite conditions.
* Fixed serious bug with leading PHP block being repeated if body tags are ommitted.
* Fixed bug where calling the same widget from a template would always use the initial tag parameters instead of updating at each call.
